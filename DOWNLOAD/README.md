Hey All! (All being a questionable word as I don't expect more than my pal Nacho to ever be reading this)

To download simply download all the contents of this folder and make sure to keep them all in the same folder wherever
you leave them on your computer!!!

Since this project has been made by a low level CS major from Boston, MA, It does not have a working update engine
Unfortunately, that means that every time you would like to update the game, you would have to delete your version
and come back here to reinstall. There is a small shortcut which I will include here, and I apologize for the inconvenience.
Here's the process:

1) run the file update.bat
1.5) if this is your first time updating, type yes then hit enter
2) once the line comes up asking for a password, type in "chessisfun" <----------- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
3) then you should have the update

Otherwise just come to the github repo and reinstall everything which shouldnt take long either. I will try to implement
a way to notify users when there is an update, but I am also taking classes which takes up alot of my free time

thanks,
Ben
